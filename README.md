Plain Java DCI (v0.8)

This is an attempt to implement DCI in plain Java. However, as an example it is not quite ready yet to be announced.

What still needs to be done for v 1.0 are the following
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Extend RoleTest with test cases showing built in collections, like java.util.HashMap, can be used as role players.
2. Extend CalculateShortestPathTest with at least one more test case showing the right result can truly be found.
3. Rewrite this page with information on why this example has been created, what the short comings are and general
information on DCI.

Feel happy to clone and play around with the code. If you wish to help, send a pull request.
