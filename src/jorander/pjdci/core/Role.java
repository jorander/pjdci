/**
 * An abstract super class used for implementing Roles inside a DCI context.
 * A role in a context is implemented through a private static wrapper
 * class with role methods as public methods and any supporting methods
 * needed as private methods.
 * This super class takes care of the wrapping part where the role player object
 * is stored in the protected final <code>rolePlayer</code> field. This super class,
 * together with the <code>RolePlayer</code> interface and the <code>AbstractRolePlayer</code>
 * super class, makes sure <code>equals(), hashCode() and toString()</code> methods are all
 * properly implemented, e.i. targets the role player object instead of the wrapping
 * role implementation. See the <code>RoleTest</code> class for examples of how
 * this is working.
 * As long as the familiar Java-rule of using <code>equals()</code> instead of
 * <code>==</code> for object comparisons, is followed this takes care of the
 * object identification problems the could arise within a CDI-implementation
 * based on object wrapping.
 *
 * @param <RP> the type or interface describing the role contract, i.e. the
 *            contract the role player must implement.
